## Sources

* [official website of the 2014 IPC][1]
* [archive with benchmark instances][2]

## Additional Notes

The [official website of the 2014 IPC][1] provides **two archives containing the benchmark instances,** the [original archive][3] and an [updated one][2].
The updated archive contains fixes for problematic domains and removes unsolvable instances (see the [full list of changes][4]).
This repository contains the instances from the **updated benchmark archive.**

## Modifications

* renamed problem domains and instances for consistency
