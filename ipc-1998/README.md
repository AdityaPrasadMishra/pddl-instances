## Sources

* [official website of the 1998 IPC][1]
* [revised archive with benchmark instances][2]
* [original archive with benchmark instances][3]

## Additional Notes

The [official website of the 1998 IPC][1] provides **two archives containing the benchmark instances.**
[One archive][2] contains the instances in a “simple form,” while the [other archive][3] is considered the “original … more complicated” one.

There are **slight differences between the archives.**
It cannot be reconstructed which versions of the domains were actually used in the competition and should be considered official.

In the case of ambiguities, it was attempted to make the most reasonable choice or interpretation.
Such decisions are documentated as *additional notes* in the individual readmes of the competition domain.

## Modifications

* renamed problem domains and instances for consistency
