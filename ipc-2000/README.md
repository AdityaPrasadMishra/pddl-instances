# 2nd International Planning Competition, 2000

## Domains

### STRIPS

* [blocks](blocks-strips)
* [elevator](elevator-strips)
* [freecell](freecell-strips)
* [logistics](logistics-strips)

### ADL

* [elevator (simple)](elevator-adl-simple)
* [elevator (full)](elevator-adl-full)
* [schedule](schedule-adl)

## Sources

* [official website of the 2000 IPC][1]
* [archive with benchmark instances][2]
* [presentation of the results][3]

## Additional Notes

In the case that a domain existed both with typing information and without, the version *without* typing information was omitted.

The [slides with the results][3] mention another version of the *elevator* problem (with an additional constraint).
However, these instances are apparently not contained in the official benchmark instance archive.

The STRIPS version of the *schedule* problem was dropped from the competition due to an unspecified complication with the domain.

## Modifications

* renamed problem domains and instances for consistency
